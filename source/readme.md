# Make Good
## Virtual volunteering opportunities for web designers and developers

Sometimes, in the tech community, we get wrapped up in the bad stuff. Sometimes, it's stuff we need to address. But if we don't balance it out with the good, we run the risk of letting the bad stuff take over. Don't lose your perspective. We have amazing talents and resources lots of other people in the world don't have. Make something good out of them.
