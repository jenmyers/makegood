  %p.intro
    Sometimes, in the tech community, we get wrapped up in the bad stuff. Sometimes, it's stuff we need to address. Sometimes, we let it run away with us and we lose balance and perspective. So let's make sure we focus on the good, too. We have amazing talents and resources lots of other people in the world don't have. Make something good out of them.
