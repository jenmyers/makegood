  %p.intro
    Sometimes, in the tech community, we get wrapped up in the bad stuff. Sometimes, it's stuff we need to address. But it's always a good idea to keep an eye on the good, too, so that we keep balance, perspective and a healthy relationship with the larger community. We have amazing talents and resources most other people in the world don't have. Make something good out of them.
