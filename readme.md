# Make Good
## Virtual volunteering opportunities for web designers and developers

Sometimes, in the tech community, we get wrapped up in the bad stuff. Sometimes, it's stuff we need to address. But it's always a good idea to keep an eye on the good, too, so that we keep balance, perspective and a healthy relationship with the larger community. We have amazing talents and resources most other people in the world don't have. Make something good out of them.

### Want to submit a new opportunity?

Awesome. Here's how to do it by pull request:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Update the `index.html.haml` file in the `/source` folder by copying an existing opportunity listing and filling in your new information.
3. Push your updates to your fork.
4. Submit a pull request and I'll merge and publish your new volunteer opportunity to the site.

There are comments to help you determine what information to copy/change, but I am available for questions. I'm also available to help with the pull request process if you're not familiar with it but want to learn.

Additionally, you can send me volunteer opportunities two other ways:

* Via Twitter at [@antiheroine](http://twitter.com/antiheroine)
* Via email at [hello@jenmyers.net](mailto:hello@jenmyers.net)
